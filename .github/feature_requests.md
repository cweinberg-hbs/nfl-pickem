# NFL Pick'em App - Feature requests and Bugs to fix

## Feature Requests
- **All Weeks can be accessed**: 1st thought is to have a tab for each week. If that turns out to be too UI unfriendly, then propose another user friendly solution. 
- **Remove Player**: Ability to remove a player. Keep player in already completed weeks, but remove from future.
- **Over/Under**: Add the over/under score for each game (sum of both teams current/final score)
- **Monday Night Tie Breaker**: This is the over/under score (sum of both teams scores). It is then used to compate players chosen tie breaker points total if there is a tie in the number of games won. When more than one Monday night game is played, calculate the Over/Under for each game and the tie breaker will be the sum of both games.  
- **Automate Weekly Game Upload**: Instead of the admin uploading every week, use the espn api to populate the Weekly game information. Spell out exactly what is needed here:
  - Week #
  - Days (and each date)
  - Home vs Away
  - Team name
  - Game Start time
- **Add new feature here**: A very cool feature

## Bugs
- **Import not working**: File selection works, but nothing seems get imported. 
- **Add new bug here**: Some stupid annoying thing you really want fixed
